## Overview

This project involves training a model using MediaPipe to recognize various plants. The trained model is integrated into an Android application developed using Kotlin. The application identifies plants in real-time and displays basic information about the identified plant. 

## Features

- **Plant Recognition**: Identifies plants using a trained model.
- **Information Display**: Provides simple information about the identified plant.
